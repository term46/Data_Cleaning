# Data_Cleaning

The point of this script was to track the training hours for 2300 Costco Wholesale IT employees and upload it into a Power BI report, which included
a slicer by organizational hierarchy, so employees, managers, Directors, all the way up to Senior Vice Presidents able to look at the learning hours
of employees they manage.

The first section of the python script merges 3 different employee data sources and adds additional columns that are necessary to create the hierarchy slicer.

The 2nd portion of the Python script I created to merge and clean the training hours from 6 data sources; 
Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Enterprise Skills, SuccessFactors, SAP Learning Hub, and Ad-Hoc dataset.

The end result of the product was a Power BI Report template that senior management liked and has kept into production.
